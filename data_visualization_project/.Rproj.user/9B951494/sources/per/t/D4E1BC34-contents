# 1. Introduction

Despite being the fifth most populous country in the world, Pakistan is only able to spend as much as 1.7 percent of its GDP on education. The tumultuous domestic political climate, in conjunction with the global geopolitical landscape, has undeniably resulted in a series of macroeconomic crises within the nation. These crises have unfortunately led to widespread inflation, a rise in poverty, and a profound literacy crisis that poses significant challenges for future generations. A sizable children population (around 26 million) remains out of school which can have devastating impact on the opportunities of the country to grow out of these crises. 

In recent times, the World Bank has observed that Pakistan’s Human Capital Index (HCI) has dropped to 0.41, making it lower than other South Asian peers. Hence, as researchers, there is a need for greater critical understanding about rectifying and remedying the problems at hand. Rather than focusing on all-encompassing solutions, more data-driven, targeted approaches are required to provide stability to the educational sector. 

# 2. Data

In light of this, the [ASER Pakistan’s 2023 Report](https://aserpakistan.org/report) and its [data set](https://aserpakistan.org/index.php?func=data_statistics) provides valuable, and up to date insights into the household data, school related information, and children’s literacy through testing. The ASER Pakistan works as a private, non-profit think-tank but receives development funding through the government and other international non-governmental organizations to conduct a sample survey across 123 urban districts and 151 rural districts in Pakistan. The 2023 data shows that they reached out to 272,300 children to conduct their foundational literacy and proficiency tests. The ASER data sets used in this assignment and class contain observations of only rural areas of Pakistan. Since the data is collected from a sample of rural areas, the findings are not generalizable to the entire population of Pakistan. Similarly, since the data is merged across three subsets, the number of variables and observations may vary in the cleaning process by removing missing values and other inconsistencies.

# 3. Research Questions

The ASER Pakistan data set provides a wealth of information about the educational landscape in rural Pakistan. In this project, my primary focus is to relate the surveyed children to their households and schools. In this way, we can better understand the relational aspects of household factors and school characteristics that may influence the educational outcomes of children.

The following research questions will be addressed in this project:

1. What is the distribution of children enrolled in government and private schools in rural areas?
2. What is the proportion of co-educational schools versus single-gender schools in rural areas?
3. How does the proportion of psychological impact vary based on the severity of flood impact in rural areas?
4. How does the awareness of climate change influence the proportion of households experiencing an earning impact in rural areas?
5. What is the distribution of arithmetic levels by the medium of instruction for the first five grades in rural areas?

# 4. Data Cleaning and Preparation

The data cleaning and preparation process for this project involves loading the three datasets (school, child, and household) into R, renaming some column names to make them consistent, merging them, selecting the relevant columns, filtering out the missing values, making data types consistent such as integer, character or factor, and recoding variables into _CamelCase_ for better understanding. The data cleaning and preparation process is crucial for ensuring that the data is ready for analysis and visualization.

### 4.1 Loading the Data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(see)
# Loading the three datasets into R
aser_child <- read.csv("ITAASER2023Child.csv")
aser_household <- read.csv("ITAASER2023Household.csv") %>% 
  rename(HHID = HouseholdId) %>% # Renaming the HouseholdId column to HHID for merging with the Child Dataset
  rename(VMAPID = VillageMapSurveyId) # Renaming the VillageMapSurveyId column to VMAPID for merging with the School Dataset
aser_school <- read.csv("ITAASER2023School.csv")

glimpse(aser_child)
summary(aser_child)

str(aser_household)
glimpse(aser_household)

glimpse(aser_school)
summary(aser_school)

child_house <- left_join(aser_child, aser_household, by = c("HHID")) # Merging the Child and Household Datasets by HHID which stands for the unique Household ID

child_house_school <- left_join(child_house, aser_school, by = c("VMAPID")) # Merging the Child-Household Dataset that was created above with the School Dataset by VMAPID which stands for the unique Village Map Survey ID

glimpse(child_house_school)
summary(child_house_school)
head(child_house_school)

child_house_school <- child_house_school %>% 
  select(-c(RNAME.x)) %>% # Removing the RNAME.x column as it is redundant and not needed
  rename(RNAME = RNAME.y) %>% # Renaming the RNAME.y column to RNAME for better understanding
  select(-c(DNAME.x)) %>% # Removing the DNAME.x column as it is redundant and not needed
  rename(DNAME = DNAME.y) # Renaming the DNAME.y column to DNAME for better understanding

child_house_school <- child_house_school %>% 
  select(-c(AREA.x)) %>% # Removing the AREA.x column as it is redundant and not needed
  rename(AREA = AREA.y) # Renaming the AREA.y column to AREA for better understanding

colnames(child_house_school) # Checking the column names of the final dataset

```

### 4.2 Selecting the Required Columns

```{r}
# --- 1. Selecting Relevant Variables from Household-Level, Child-Level, and School-Level Observations ---
child_house_school <- child_house_school %>% 
  select(
    # Dataset Identifiers
    HHID, VMAPID, Id, AREA, RNAME, DNAME,
    
    # Household Characteristics
    HouseType, HouseholdCounter, EarningMembers, Car, MotorCycle,
    
    # Time to school
    TravelTime,
    
    # Climate Change Impact
    ClimateChange, FloodImpacted, EarningImpacted, PsychologicalImpacted, SchoolingAffected,
    
    # School Characteristics - SchoolType, TeachersAppointed, TeachersPresent, SingleOrCoEdSchool, InstructionMedium, ChildrenEnrolled, ChildrenPresent
    STYPE, S008TA, S008TP, S001, S002, S007E, S007P,
    
    # Child Characteristics - EducationalStatus, Grades, InstitutionType, LocalLangReadingLevel, ArithmeticLevel, EnglishReadingLevel
    VCODES, C05, C12, C10, C11, C15, C19, C20
  ) %>%
  rename(
    # School Characteristics - SchoolType, TeachersAppointed, TeachersPresent, SingleOrCoEdSchool, InstructionMedium, ChildrenEnrolled, ChildrenPresent
    SchoolType = STYPE, TeachersAppointed = S008TA, TeachersPresent = S008TP, SingleOrCoEdSchool = S001, InstructionMedium = S002, ChildrenEnrolled = S007E, ChildrenPresent = S007P,
    
    # Child Characteristics - EducationalStatus, Grades, InstitutionType, LocalLangReadingLevel, ArithmeticLevel, EnglishReadingLevel
    EducationalStatus = C05, Grades = C10, SurveyedChildToSchool = C12, InstitutionType = C11, LocalLangReadingLevel = C15, ArithmeticLevel = C19, EnglishReadingLevel = C20
  
  )
```

### 4.3 Filtering Out Values

```{r}
# --- 1. Filter by NAs and Replacing Some NA Values with 0 where applies ---
child_house_school_filtered <- child_house_school %>%
  filter(!is.na(HouseType), !is.na(HouseholdCounter), !is.na(EarningMembers), !is.na(Car), !is.na(MotorCycle), !is.na(TravelTime), !is.na(ClimateChange), !is.na(FloodImpacted), !is.na(EarningImpacted), !is.na(PsychologicalImpacted), !is.na(SchoolingAffected)) %>%
  mutate(
  TeachersAppointed = replace(TeachersAppointed, is.na(TeachersAppointed), 0),
  TeachersPresent = replace(TeachersPresent, is.na(TeachersPresent), 0),
  SchoolType = replace(SchoolType, is.na(SchoolType), 0),
  SingleOrCoEdSchool = replace(SingleOrCoEdSchool, is.na(SingleOrCoEdSchool), 0),
  InstructionMedium = replace(InstructionMedium, is.na(InstructionMedium), 0),
  ChildrenEnrolled = replace(ChildrenEnrolled, is.na(ChildrenEnrolled), 0),
  ChildrenPresent = replace(ChildrenPresent, is.na(ChildrenPresent), 0)
)

# --- 2. Filtering Data Based on Whether the Child Went to Surveyed School or Not  ---

# This is an important relational step as the data contains observations where the child was surveyed but the school was not surveyed and vice versa. Hence, we want to focus on understanding the relational aspect where each observation corresponds to the other observation.

child_house_school_filtered <- child_house_school_filtered %>%
  filter((SurveyedChildToSchool != 0)) # Filtering out only those children who were surveyed and their schools were surveyed as well

```

### 4.4 Making Data Types Consistent

```{r}
child_house_school_filtered <- child_house_school_filtered %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor) %>% # Convert character columns to factors
  mutate_if(is.numeric, as.integer) # Convert numeric columns to integers
```

# 6. Discussion

The bar graph for school type distribution shows that the majority of children are enrolled in government schools compared to private schools. Since the observations are concentrated in rural areas instead of urban, this distribution tends well to the hypothesis that the majority students in rural areas access education through government (public) schools.

The scatter plot for children enrolled vs. children present by school type in each rural region shows that there is a positive correlation between the number of children enrolled and the number of children present in both government and private schools. The linear regression line indicates that as the number of children enrolled increases, the number of children present also increases. This suggests that the schools are able to maintain a good attendance rate for the children enrolled. This is remarkable as it shows that the schools have been resilient in dealing with the after effects of the 2022 floods in Pakistan which resulted in significant impact on the infrastructure of schools, and schooling outcomes of children.

The stacked bar graphs for understanding the relationship between the climate change awareness and the proportion of households experiencing an earning impact, and the flood impact and the proportion of psychological impact, show that there is a significant proportion of households experiencing an earning impact due to climate change. This is a concerning finding as it suggests that the awareness of climate change is not translating into effective policy measures to mitigate the impact on the earning capacity of households. Similarly, the proportion of psychological impact due to flood impact is also significant, which indicates that the psychological well-being of individuals is being affected by the natural disasters in the region.

The distribution of arithmetic levels by the medium of instruction for the primary grades shows that the majority of students are able to reach the arithmetic level of numbers 1-9 in the first five grades. This is a positive finding as it suggests that the students are able to grasp the basic arithmetic concepts in the early grades. However, there is a need to focus on improving the arithmetic levels for the higher grades to ensure that the students are able to build on their foundational knowledge and skills.The performance of schools based on the medium of instruction is also a significant finding as it shows that the students are able to perform comparatively similar in arithmetic for all three major mediums. This goes against the common perception that students perform better in English medium schools compared to Urdu and Sindhi medium schools. However, more research is needed to understand the factors that contribute to the performance of students in different mediums of instruction.
